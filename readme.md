The project is just a simple django app and dockerized. added github action and every git pushing going to build docker iamge and automatically pushing to docker image registry.


A few usefull command:

 `sudo docker inspect <containerid/name>` to check all the network info and everything
` sudo docker image ls` list docker iamge

# github action/workflow:
01. Please `.github/workflow` where we added github action to build docker and push github package restiry to docker package registry

# 1. 
Please write a server program (any programming language) that will implement the following functionality:
a.after launching the container, the server leaves in the logs information about the date of launch, first and last name of the server author (student's first and last name) and the TCP port on which the server listens for the client's requests.
b. based on the IP address of the client connecting to the server, the browser should display a page informing about the client's IP address and based on this IP address, about the date and time in its time zone.

In the report, please include the software code along with the necessary comments.

### Solution
  A few usefull command:

 `sudo docker inspect <containerid/name>` to check all the network info and everything
` sudo docker image ls` list docker iamge and check which image created when
`sudo docker-compose up --build -d` to run and build the project in your machine, which will run in daemon mode



2. 
Develop a Dockerfile file that will allow you to build an image of the container implementing the functionality described in point 1. The assessment will take into account the method of developing this file (selection of the base image, multi-stage image building, possible use of the scratch layer, optimization of the cache in the building process) . The Dockerfile should also contain information about the author of this file (again the first and last name of the student).

In the report, please include the Dockerfile with the necessary comments.

```
FROM python:3
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
WORKDIR /code
COPY requirements.txt /code/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . /code/
```

```
version: '3.9'

services:
  web:
      build: .
      command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
      volumes:
        - .:/code
      ports:
        - "8000:8000"
```

# 3. 
Provide the commands necessary for:
a.building a developed container image,
b. launching the container on the basis of the built image,
c. the method of obtaining the information generated by the server during the container startup (see point 1a),
d. check how many layers the built image has.

The report should include the content of the commands (points a - d) together with any comments and a screenshot of the browser window confirming the correct operation of the system.

### Solution
> A: `docker-compose --build`
> B: to lunch the container, check the docker-compse file below:

```
version: '3.7'

services:
  server:
    image: ryszardfullstack/docker_task:tagname
```

> C:  `sudo docker inspect <containerid/name>` to check all the network info and everything
`docker history --no-trunc <Image ID>`

# 4. 
Build container images with the application developed in # 1, which will work on the following architectures: linux / arm / v7, linux / arm64 / v8 and linux / amd64. These images should be uploaded to your repository on DockerHub. The instructions used should be included in the report, together with the result of their operation and any comments.



NOTE: (+ 10%) All information that must be provided in the report (points 1-4) can be processed in the form of the file task1.md and this file should be placed on the GitHub account as a customary description of the content of the git repository. In this repository, please also place the developed sources for the server and the prepared Dockerfile (and all other files that you think are necessary). In this case, only a text file containing links to the used repository on GitHub and DockerHub can be submitted as a report.
 
Additional points (max. 50%)
Among all studies of Task 1, obligatory part, a solution (or solutions) using the image with the smallest size will be selected and "rewarded" with additional points - max. 50%




### Solution

Please check `.github/workflow/` both github regestry and dockerhub registry code there, also the build sucess, you can check in github action



5. Carry out step 4:
- with the use of GitHubActions
- additionally with the cache export setting and confirmation of the correctness of this method -
max. thirty%
- with data transfer not to DockerHub but to the GitHub repository along with a short description of the GitHub Container Registry configuration
(supporting link: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/ working-with-the-container-registry)

In the report, please include a description of the configurations made in succession along with the necessary comments.
